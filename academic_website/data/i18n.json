A particular emphasis of his work lies on security-related development and vulnerability coordination in open-source projects. His research has been published in peer-reviewed international journals, including the Journal of Systems and Software and the International Journal of Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering. He actively supports transparent and reproducible empirical software engineering research through openly available data and replication packages. In addition to his academic work, he is employed in the insurance industry, which informs his interest in large-scale, real-world software ecosystems.",
